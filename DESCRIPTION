Description: This package implements multiple linear regression and ridge regression 
    using R's S3 object-oriented system. It provides functions for model fitting, 
    coefficient extraction, prediction, residuals, and performance summaries. 
    Additional vignettes demonstrate predictive modeling on real-world datasets 
    such as 'BostonHousing', including visualization of model performance and 
    interpretation of ridge regularization effects. 
    Developed as part of the lab assignment for the course 732A94 Advanced R Programming 
    at LinkÃ¶ping University.
